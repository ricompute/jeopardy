## CSV Format

```

Example:

```csv
Round,Category,Order,Prompt,Answer
1,Science,1,This molecule has the chemical formula H2O,What is water?
1,Science,2,The closest star to Earth,What is the Sun?
1,Science,3,This force keeps planets in orbit,What is gravity?
1,Science,4,The number of bones in an adult human,What is 206?
1,History,1,Year the Declaration was signed,What is 1776?
...
2,Technology,1,This company created the iPhone,What is Apple?
2,Technology,2,The programming language created by Guido van Rossum,What is Python?
...
Final,Ancient Wonders,Final,This wonder was located in Alexandria,What is the Lighthouse?
```

**Key points:**
- **Round**: Use `1` for Jeopardy, `2` for Double Jeopardy, `Final` for Final Jeopardy
- **Category**: The category name (for Final Jeopardy, this is the actual category shown to players)
- **Order**: Use `1`, `2`, `3`, `4` for question position (easiest to hardest), or `Final`
- For a single-round game, simply omit Round 2 questions
- Each round needs 5 categories with 4 questions each (20 questions per round)
- Download the template from within the app

## Configurable Point Values

Before starting the game, you can set custom point values for each row:

| Row | Default | Example Custom |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| 1 | $200 | $100 |
| 2 | $400 | $200 |
| 3 | $600 | $300 |
| 4 | $800 | $400 |

In Double Jeopardy (Round 2), all values are automatically doubled.

## Game Structure

| Round | Categories | Questions | Daily Doubles | Point Values |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Jeopardy (Round 1) | 5 | 20 | 1 | Your configured values |
| Double Jeopardy (Round 2) | 5 | 20 | 2 | 2× your configured values |
| Final Jeopardy | 1 | 1 | — | Wager |

## CSV Validation

The game validates your CSV file before starting and will warn you about:

- **Invalid order values** — Values other than 1, 2, 3, 4 (or "Final")
- **Incomplete categories** — Categories missing questions for certain positions
- **Missing data** — Rows with empty category, prompt, or answer fields
- **Category count** — Fewer or more than 5 categories per round
- **Missing Final Jeopardy** — No question with "Final" as the order

You can choose to proceed with warnings or cancel to fix your CSV first.
