## CSV Format

The CSV uses a simple one-row-per-question format with four columns:

```
Category,Value,Prompt,Answer
```

Example:

```csv
Category,Value,Prompt,Answer
Science,200,This molecule has the chemical formula H2O,What is water?
Science,400,The closest star to Earth,What is the Sun?
Science,600,This force keeps planets in orbit,What is gravity?
Science,800,The number of bones in an adult human,What is 206?
History,200,Year the Declaration was signed,What is 1776?
History,400,This civilization built the pyramids at Giza,What is Egypt?
...
Final Jeopardy,Final,This wonder was located in Alexandria,What is the Lighthouse?
```

**Key points:**
- Each row is a complete, self-contained question
- Categories are identified by name (group questions by putting the same category name)
- Values should be 200, 400, 600, or 800
- For Final Jeopardy, use "Final" as the value
- Download the template from within the app or use `jeopardy_template.csv`
